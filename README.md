A project brings more than source code into your environment. Its dependencies can run install scripts. Its agent settings can approve commands or start tools. Its instructions can ask an agent to read credentials or execute a helper you have not reviewed.

Aguara checks those files for known-malicious packages, suspicious behavior, and risky permissions **before you use them**. The report points you to the affected package or file so you can investigate before installing dependencies, running CI, or giving an agent access to the project.

Use it when evaluating a repository or skill, reviewing a change, or adding a security check to an agent workflow. You do not need an AI agent to use its package and code checks.

**Analysis runs locally. No package execution, content upload, telemetry, or LLM calls.**

[Quick start](#quick-start) | [Coverage](#what-aguara-checks) | [CI](#adopting-aguara-in-ci) | [Integrations](#outputs-and-integrations) | [Development](#development) | [Security](#security)

## Quick Start

Install the published release:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garagon/aguara/v0.27.0/install.sh \
  | VERSION=v0.27.0 sh
```

The default location is `~/.local/bin`; add it to your `PATH` if needed. The installer verifies the archive checksum. See [signature verification](#verifying-signed-releases) for verifying its signing identity, or [other installation options](#installation).

From the project directory, run:

```bash
aguara audit .
```

This combines a malicious-package check with a content scan. It does not install dependencies or run the project's commands. Read the findings before taking the next step; a passing result is not a guarantee that the project is safe.

**Release boundary:** these installation examples use **v0.27.0**. The [development section](#development-version) describes features on `main` that are not in that release. In particular, v0.27.0 can honor repository-owned exclusions and suppressions: review them when inspecting an unfamiliar project. The explicit untrusted-project policy controls are a development feature.

### Reading a finding

For example, a `.claude/settings.json` containing `"allow": ["Bash(*)"]` grants broad shell approval. Aguara reports that configuration for review. A shortened JSON finding from v0.27.0:

```json
{
  "rule_id": "AGENTCFG_BROAD_ALLOW_001",
  "rule_name": "Claude Code permissions pre-approve dangerous commands",
  "severity": 2,
  "file_path": ".claude/settings.json",
  "line": 3,
  "matched_text": "Bash(*)"
}
```

Here `severity: 2` means MEDIUM. The finding is not a claim that the project is malware. It identifies a permission decision to review: does the tool need unrestricted shell access, or can the approval be narrowed?

```bash
aguara explain AGENTCFG_BROAD_ALLOW_001
aguara audit . --verbose
aguara audit . --format json
```

Review known-malicious package matches first, then the content findings and their explanations. An exit code reflects the command's failure threshold, not the absence of every risk.

## What Aguara Checks

| What you are reviewing | What Aguara looks for | Command |
|---|---|---|
| A project | Package matches and content findings together | `aguara audit .` |
| Dependencies | Resolved packages covered by malicious-package advisories | `aguara check .` |
| Agent skills and instructions | Prompt injection, suspicious requests for secrets or execution, and tool poisoning | `aguara scan ./skills/` |
| MCP configuration | Risky tool launch commands, embedded credentials, and configuration patterns | `aguara scan --auto` |
| Agent host settings | Broad approvals, fetch-and-execute hooks, and code-injection environment settings in Claude Code `.claude/settings.json` and `settings.local.json` | `aguara scan .claude/` |
| Package-manager policy | Explicit npm and pnpm settings that relax install-time protections | `aguara scan .` |
| Project code and CI | Suspicious install hooks, credential access, execution chains, and GitHub Actions trust risks | `aguara scan .` |

`scan --auto` discovers supported MCP client configurations on the machine. Use `aguara discover` to inspect that inventory. Configuration coverage is specific to supported file formats; it does not imply support for every agent host.

### Packages and lockfiles

Lockfiles let Aguara check resolved dependencies without installing them. Coverage depends on what the file records and what the active intelligence snapshot knows.

| Ecosystem | Evidence read |
|---|---|
| npm | `node_modules`, pnpm store, `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, classic and Berry `yarn.lock`, text `bun.lock` |
| PyPI | Installed `site-packages`, `.pth` files, supported cache locations |
| Go | `go.sum`, `go.mod` |
| Rust | Public-registry entries in `Cargo.lock` |
| PHP | `composer.lock` |
| Ruby | `Gemfile.lock` |
| Java | `pom.xml`, Gradle lockfiles |
| .NET | `packages.lock.json`, supported project files |

Matching supports exact versions and advisories affecting every version of a package. Bounded version ranges are supported for npm semver, not arbitrary ranges in every ecosystem. This is malicious-package detection, not comprehensive CVE coverage.

Unambiguous `npm:` aliases resolve to the real package in package-lock, pnpm, Yarn Berry, and Bun. Classic Yarn aliases and ambiguous non-registry identities are skipped rather than assigned a guessed package identity. Binary `bun.lockb` is not parsed; a repository with only that file returns an error asking for text `bun.lock`.

### Behavior and policy

Aguara also inspects code for behaviors that do not depend on a package already being listed in an advisory: suspicious second-stage execution, credential transmission, host-file tampering, and destructive cleanup. It combines signatures, parsed configuration, bounded code analysis, and heuristic correlations. Binding checks to actual calls reduces noise, but it does not eliminate false positives or provide whole-program dataflow analysis.

The npm checks read `package.json` and project `.npmrc`; pnpm checks read `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. They flag explicit settings such as blanket script approval or weakened source restrictions. A missing setting is not reported. That does **not** prove the effective package-manager configuration is secure: the installed version, environment, and command-line overrides also matter. See [the rule reference](RULES.md) for individual checks and use `aguara explain <RULE_ID>` for their scope.

## Threat Intel

The binary includes an advisory snapshot sourced from [OSV](https://osv.dev), including [OpenSSF Malicious Packages](https://github.com/ossf/malicious-packages), alongside manually curated incident records. OSV is an open-source vulnerability database developed by Google; Aguara imports a malicious-package-focused subset, not its entire CVE database.

A package finding identifies the advisory behind the match. Check that record and its affected versions when investigating; the snapshot is not a complete inventory of every malicious package.

Checks use embedded intelligence and any configured local cache without fetching the files being scanned. Refreshing intelligence is an explicit network operation:

```bash
aguara status
aguara update
aguara check . --fresh
```

`update` and `--fresh` fetch and verify Aguara's signed advisory bundle. Later checks can use the verified local cache offline. Snapshot age is context, not evidence that a dependency is safe or malicious.

The explicit `--insecure-intel` escape hatch skips signature verification only
when `AGUARA_INSECURE_INTEL=1` is also set. Such downloads are labeled unverified
and cannot be reused by default checks or `--allow-stale`. Older cache markers
do not reliably establish that a signature was verified; run `aguara update`
without `--insecure-intel` to restore verified offline use after upgrading.

Release notices are separate from analysis: `aguara version` can check for a newer release, and v0.27.0 also does this during `scan`. Set `AGUARA_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable those checks. For network-isolated use, set that variable and avoid `update` and `--fresh`; no online lookup is needed to analyze the content.

## Adopting Aguara in CI

Run the audit **before** dependency installation or project commands:

```bash
aguara audit . --ci
```

`audit --ci` fails on critical findings by default. `scan --ci` uses a high-or-above threshold instead. Review the threshold for the command you integrate; they are not interchangeable.

To introduce a gate in an existing project, record and review a baseline:

```bash
aguara audit . --write-baseline .aguara-baseline.json
aguara audit . --ci --baseline .aguara-baseline.json
```

Baseline-matched content findings remain visible but do not fail the gate. New findings are evaluated against the selected threshold. Compromised-package findings are not baselineable, and sensitive findings are omitted when writing a baseline. A missing or malformed baseline returns an error. Treat baseline changes as security decisions during review.

## Installation

The following alternatives install the published version, not the development features below.

```bash
# Homebrew
brew install garagon/tap/aguara

# Docker: read-only project mount, non-root container
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/repo:ro" ghcr.io/garagon/aguara:0.27.0 audit /repo

# Go: pinned release; requires Go 1.25.5 or later
go install github.com/garagon/aguara/cmd/aguara@v0.27.0
```

Release binaries are available for Linux, macOS, and Windows on the [Releases page](https://github.com/garagon/aguara/releases). The container supports Linux amd64 and arm64. Go installs do not inject release version metadata; use release artifacts when that metadata or signature verification is required.

### GitHub Action

The Action runs a content scan, not the combined package audit. Pin both the Action and its binary:

```yaml
- uses: garagon/aguara@v0.27.0
  with:
    path: .
    fail-on: high
    version: v0.27.0
```

The default SARIF upload needs `security-events: write`. See [`action.yml`](action.yml) for inputs; use the CLI audit in a separate CI step when you also need package-intelligence checks.

## Outputs and Integrations

`scan` offers terminal, JSON, SARIF, and Markdown output. `audit` offers a combined terminal or JSON report. Use SARIF from `scan` for GitHub Code Scanning; other SAST services may require a different schema.

The [Go library](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/garagon/aguara) exposes the same content-scanning engine for tools that need analysis without a CLI subprocess:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"

    "github.com/garagon/aguara"
)

func main() {
    result, err := aguara.ScanContent(context.Background(), "Content to inspect", "skill.md")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    for _, finding := range result.Findings {
        fmt.Printf("%s %s:%d\n", finding.RuleID, finding.FilePath, finding.Line)
    }
}
```

`Scan` accepts a file or directory; `ScanContent` accepts content directly without loading a file. `ListRules` and `ExplainRule` expose the catalog. Pin the Go module version in your application. Consumers can call the engine during a live workflow, but interception, authorization, session policy, and enforcement remain the consumer's responsibility.

[Aguara MCP](https://github.com/garagon/mcp-aguara) is a separate integration that exposes scanning tools to agents. Aguara itself does not require an MCP server, hosted account, or model provider.

## Limitations

- **A clean report is not a safety certificate.** Unsupported formats, dynamic code, incomplete inputs, and threats absent from the rules or intelligence can be missed. Inspect errors and what was actually scanned.
- **A finding is evidence to review, not always proof of malicious intent.** Legitimate provisioning, release scripts, and examples can resemble risky behavior.
- **Static analysis does not enforce runtime isolation.** Aguara does not sandbox a package, revoke a credential, intercept a tool call, or prevent an agent from executing a command on its own.
- **Coverage is bounded.** It does not replace application SAST, general CVE/SCA analysis, or runtime monitoring. Shell parsing and dataflow support vary by detector.
- **Results depend on the analysis inputs.** Compare findings with the same engine version, rules, configuration, intelligence snapshot, and monitor state where applicable. Timing fields are not deterministic.
- **Reports can contain sensitive material.** Review findings and context before sharing or retaining them; do not assume every part of a report is safe to publish.

## Development Version

**The following capabilities are on `main`, not in v0.27.0.** See [Unreleased changes](CHANGELOG.md#unreleased). Building from source is not equivalent to installing a signed release.

| Capability | What changes for the caller |
|---|---|
| Untrusted-project policy | `audit` and CI scans ignore target-owned suppressions by default; local `scan` can still trust project policy. Use `--project-policy ignore` explicitly when inspecting unfamiliar content. |
| Triage and agent handoff | Audit JSON adds `triage`, `agent_handoff`, and `action_plan`: review priorities and guidance about the next action. These fields do not enforce permissions. |
| Decision impact | Findings distinguish supporting `context` from `review` signals. Severity and explicit failure thresholds remain separate. |
| Skill and helper checks | Skill frontmatter and instruction-to-helper correlation add checks for broad tool approval and required local helpers with suspicious behavior. |
| Script analysis and catalog | Additional Python/shell analysis and unified rule enumeration expose analyzer rules through `list-rules` and `explain`. |

For a development build, clone the repository, review and check out the commit you intend to test, then run `make build`. Record that commit alongside your results. Use the resulting local binary, not an older installation on your `PATH`:

```bash
./aguara scan ./skills/ --project-policy ignore
./aguara audit . --format json
```

The development catalog contains **258 detections: 192 YAML pattern rules and 66 analyzer-emitted detections**. The installed binary's `aguara list-rules` is the reference for its own catalog. This count is not the number of malicious-package records in the intelligence snapshot.

## Rules and Architecture

Content analysis combines pattern matching and decoding, configuration parsers, language-specific checks, prompt-injection analysis, and bounded cross-file correlation. On `main`, thirteen per-file analyzers run by default; rug-pull tracking joins with `--monitor`. Skill-chain correlation runs separately across files.

Package-intelligence checking is a separate path used by `check` and combined with content analysis by `audit`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the package layout and [RULES.md](RULES.md) for detection details.

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [`aguara.go`](aguara.go) | Public Go API and result types |
| [`internal/scanner`](internal/scanner) | File discovery, analyzer execution, and result collection |
| [`internal/engine`](internal/engine) | Content analyzers and their registry |
| [`internal/rules`](internal/rules) | Pattern-rule loading, compilation, and built-in definitions |
| [`internal/packagecheck`](internal/packagecheck) | Package and lockfile parsing |
| [`internal/incident`](internal/incident) | Package-intelligence checks and incident evidence |
| [`cmd/aguara`](cmd/aguara) | CLI commands and workflow integration |

```bash
aguara list-rules
aguara explain CRED_002
aguara scan . --rules ./my-rules/
```

Custom rules and local configuration can change coverage. Review `.aguara.yml`, `.aguaraignore`, custom rules, and inline suppressions before trusting a project's scan policy. Use `aguara init` to scaffold a local configuration. The `--project-policy` boundary described above applies only to development builds until it is released.

## Verifying Signed Releases

Release archives have checksums signed with Cosign keyless and include SPDX SBOMs. Container images are signed at their digest with SBOM and SLSA provenance attestations. Verify the signing identity as well as the checksum:

```bash
VERSION=v0.27.0
ARCHIVE=aguara_${VERSION#v}_linux_amd64.tar.gz

curl -fsSLO https://github.com/garagon/aguara/releases/download/${VERSION}/${ARCHIVE}
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/garagon/aguara/releases/download/${VERSION}/checksums.txt
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/garagon/aguara/releases/download/${VERSION}/checksums.txt.bundle

cosign verify-blob \
  --bundle checksums.txt.bundle \
  --certificate-identity "https://github.com/garagon/aguara/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/${VERSION}" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  checksums.txt

sha256sum --check --ignore-missing checksums.txt
```

For the container:

```bash
cosign verify ghcr.io/garagon/aguara:${VERSION#v} \
  --certificate-identity "https://github.com/garagon/aguara/.github/workflows/docker.yml@refs/tags/${VERSION}" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
```

The install script checks archive integrity but does not perform this signature-verification step. A verified release identifies the publisher and artifact; it does not guarantee detection of every threat.

## Development

Use the Go version required by [`go.mod`](go.mod) and install golangci-lint for the lint target. From a reviewed checkout:

```bash
make build
make test
make vet
make lint
```

`make build` writes `./aguara`. `make test` runs the Go suite with the race detector, including positive and negative rule examples and saved fuzz inputs. The repository also includes native fuzz targets and benchmarks; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [Makefile](Makefile) for targeted runs.

This repository intentionally contains attack examples and detection fixtures. Scanning the Aguara checkout is not a substitute for running its tests, and findings in those fixtures are not evidence that the scanner itself is compromised.

## Contributing

For a bug or false positive, [open an issue](https://github.com/garagon/aguara/issues) with the engine version, command, expected result, and a minimal non-sensitive example. Discuss substantial changes before implementation. Detection changes should include positive cases and realistic benign cases, not just additional signatures.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup and the pull request process, and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for community expectations. Changes go through pull requests and CI. Release history is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

The previous Aguara Watch observatory is not a supported product surface. Current development focuses on the scanner and its integrations.

## Security

Report vulnerabilities in Aguara privately through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/garagon/aguara/security/advisories/new), not a public issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for scope and supported versions. Do not include credentials or private project content in public reports.
